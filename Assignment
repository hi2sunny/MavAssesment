Assignment 1

Ans: ReplicasSet will ensure that the number of pods (defined in our config file) is always running in our cluster. 
Does not matter in which worker node they are running. The scheduler will schedule the pods on any node depending upon the free resources. 
If one of our nodes goes down then all pods running on the node will be randomly scheduled on different nodes as per the resource availability. 
In this way, ReplicaSet ensures that the number of pods of an application is running on the correct scale as specified in the conf file.

Whereas In DaemonSet it will ensure that one copy of pod defined in our configuration will always be available on every worker node.

Common use: If you want to ftech some information like RAM CPU usage free space you can use this daemon set instaed of replicaset,
because it run on every node to fetch you required data
